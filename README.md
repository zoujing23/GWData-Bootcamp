## Getting Started

Welcome to the course project! To get started with your programming assignments, you'll need to set up your workspace. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through the process.

### Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Account and Fork the Repository

1. **Create a GitHub Account**: If you don't already have a GitHub account, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up.
2. **Fork the Course Repository**:
    - Navigate to the course's GitHub repository: [GWData-Bootcamp](https://github.com/iphysresearch/GWData-Bootcamp).
    - Click on the `Fork` button at the top right of the page.
    - In the fork settings, make sure to **uncheck** the option 'copy `main` branch only'.
3. **Clone the Forked Repository**:
    - Open your terminal or Git Bash.
    - Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
      ```shell
      git clone git@github.com:<YourGitHubUsername>/GWData-Bootcamp.git
      ```
    - Replace `<YourGitHubUsername>` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Local Workspace

1. **Switch to the `homework` Branch**:
    - Navigate to your cloned repository's directory:
      ```shell
      cd GWData-Bootcamp
      ```
    - Switch to the `homework` branch using:
      ```shell
      git switch homework
      ```
2. **Create Your Personal Homework Directory**:
    - Inside the `GWData-Bootcamp` directory, create a new directory path for your homework submissions:
      ```shell
      mkdir -p 2023/homework/<YourName>
      ```
      - Replace `<YourName>` with your name or a unique identifier.

### Step 3: Submitting Your Homework

1. **Complete Your Assignments**:
     - Add your completed assignments to your personal homework directory that you created in the previous step.
     - The assignments should be named as `python_submit.txt`, `numpy_submit.txt`, or `pandas_submit.txt` depending on the type of the assignment.
2. **Push Your Changes**:
     - Stage and commit your changes. For example:
       ```shell
       git add .
       git commit -m "Add homework for <SpecificHomework>"
       ```
     - Push your `homework` branch to your forked repository:
       ```shell
       git push origin homework
       ```
3. **Create a Pull Request**:
    - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
    - Switch to the `homework` branch.
    - Click on New Pull Request.
    - Ensure the base repository is set to the original `GWData-Bootcamp` repository and the base branch is set to `homework`.
    - Complete the PR form and submit.
    - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically check your submission ([Homework](2023/python/readme.md#homework)) and compare it with the solution. If your submission passes the check, a merge request will be initiated. Please note that only the repository owners have the authority to merge the request.


### Important Notes

- **Do Not Modify Other Students' Work**: It's crucial that you do not make any changes to other students' homework directories and contents.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your fork synchronized with the main repository to get the latest updates and assignments.
- Automated Checks: The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically check your submission when you create a pull request. Make sure your submission passes the check before you submit it.
- Happy Coding! 🚀👩‍💻👨
